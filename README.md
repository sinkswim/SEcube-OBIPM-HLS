# SEcube-OBIPM-HLS
Design and implementation of the on-board IP Manager for the Blu5 SEcube SoC platform.

The group project consisted in:
* CPU-FPGA protocol definition;
* SystemC implementation;
* High-level synthesis of the SystemC modules with Cadence Stratus HLS and Xilinx Vivado HLS;
* Integration of the various generated RTL designs in the Lattice Diamond SW package and compilation of the bitstream file to be deployed on the SEcube SoC.
